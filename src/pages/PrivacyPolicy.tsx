          We collect only the information required to run Places in Time, keep accounts secure, and understand how the
          atlas is being used. This overview explains what data we store, why we store it, and how you can exercise your

        <p>
          When you create an account or sign up for updates we store your name, email, and any profile settings you
          provide. Usage analytics are captured in aggregate to show us which pages resonate and which conversations need
          more training. If you submit content or feedback, we log the text plus the timestamp so we can follow up.

          Aggregate analytics help us prioritize new figures, places, and interface improvements. We never sell data to
          third parties, and any vendor processing information on our behalf must comply with GDPR terms.
