        <h1>About Places in Time</h1>
        <p>
          Places in Time is a design-forward atlas that pairs historic sites, key figures, and conversational research so
          every visit feels documented, cited, and alive.

        <h2>What we&apos;re building</h2>
        <p>
          We are stitching together a unified storytelling system: map data, archival summaries, portrait-grade imagery,
          and an echo archive that keeps quotes and context only a tap away. Each component is built to swap seamlessly
          between product demos, cultural pilots, and museum partners without losing the visual language.

        <h2>Who it&apos;s for</h2>
        <p>
          Places in Time serves curators, educators, and curious travelers who need fast, trustworthy handoffs between
          research and experience. Whether you are planning a classroom residency, plotting a heritage trail, or giving
          visitors a digital host, the atlas keeps sources transparent and tone consistent.

        <h2>How to get involved</h2>
        <p>
          We collaborate with regional archives, guides, and studios who want to surface their collections in a generous
          way. Share the places you steward, the figures you interpret, or the oral histories you are ready to record—we
          can fold them into the feed and ensure they ship with the same polish.
