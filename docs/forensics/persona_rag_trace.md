# Persona & RAG execution trace

Backend chat implementation not present in workspace. No server routers, persona prompts, safety metadata, RAG selection, LLM assembly, or persistence code available to trace.

Result: UNKNOWN for all requested steps (router → persona load → context selection → LLM call → persistence; skip/failure points cannot be inspected without backend code).
